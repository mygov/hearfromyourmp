<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
<ol>

<li>Users are allowed a maximum of two posts per day. This policy is
part of hard-worn experience from local political discussion forums
around the world, and it has been proven to encourage people to think
and consider more before they post.

<li>The purpose of each discussion is for constructive debate on the
issues set forth in each email a <?=$rep_type ?> sends.  You can write to your
<?=$rep_type ?> asking for him/her to discuss certain issues, but you must stick
roughly to the topic raised.

<li>The following behaviours are deemed unacceptable, and will result
in your posts being deleted, and/or your account being removed: ad
hominem attacks on a <?=$rep_type ?> or other users, irrelevant and off-topic
responses (see 2), and partisan posturing which isn't really trying to
solve the problems being discussed. This may all seem a bit tough, but
<?=$_SERVER['site_name'] ?> is a public space, and we reserve all rights to keep it
a nice one.

<li>We do not allow you to hit reply and write directly back to your <?=$rep_type ?>
&mdash; this is to prevent their email address being harvested for spam.
Rather, we encourage private responses back through
<a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a>,
linked from the bottom of every new message email.

</ol>
