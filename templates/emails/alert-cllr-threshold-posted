Subject: HearFromYourCouncillor update - you've now got <?=$values['subscribers']?> constituents subscribed

Dear <?=$values['rep_forename']?>,

This is just an automatic update email to let you know that there are
now <?=$values['subscribers']?> constituents in
<?=$values['area_name']?> who would like to hear from you.
All you have to do to send a new message is visit:
    <?=$values['message_url']?>

You or another councillor for your ward have used the service before,
so this is just a short email. We'll remind you again when you have
<?=$values['next_threshold']?>, but we won't email again for at least
one month.

As always, if you have any further questions, please follow this link

Or email us at team@hearfromyourmp.com, or call us on 07811 082158.

All the best,
The HearFromYourCouncillor Team
