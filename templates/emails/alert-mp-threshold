Subject: <?=$values['subscribers']?> of your constituents would like to hear from you

Dear <?=$values['mp_forename']?>,

This is an email to let you know that there are <?=$values['subscribers']?> constituents
in <?=$values['constituency_name']?> who would like to hear from you
about any issue you consider to be of particular importance at the
moment. All you have to do to talk to them is visit:
    <?=$values['message_url']?>

This mail has been sent by HearFromYourMP.com, a free service from
charitable project mySociety.org. mySociety.org also runs
www.WriteToThem.com (formerly FaxYourMP.com), civic action site
www.PledgeBank.com and www.TheyWorkForYou.com .

HearFromYourMP.com is a strictly non-partisan site which is trying to
build healthier and more productive long-term relationships between
representatives and represented. That is why have launched the site
now, long before the next general election. <?=$values['mps_using']?>
MPs have already used HearFromYourMP to send messages to their
constituents -- you can see what they said at
    http://www.hearfromyourmp.com/about
 
When you send a message, your constituents will be able to discuss what
you say in a public forum. You can also respond to comments in the
forum if you so wish. The forum has 'post-hoc' moderation, and we have
a strict code of good behavior that we will enforce -- no unconstructive
partisanship, no ad hominem attacks, etc. You can write to your
constituents whenever you feel like by visiting:
    <?=$values['message_url']?>

Constituents will not be able to reply to your mail and write back to
you directly, filling up your inbox. If a constituent wants to write
to you privately they will be passed through to WriteToThem.com with
all the anti-abuse filters we have built to protect all the UK's
elected representatives, from councillors to MEPs.

If you are not interested in using this service at the moment, we will
send you a reminder when you have <?=$values['next_threshold']?>
constituents signed up. If you have any further questions, please email
team@hearfromyourmp.com, call us on 07811 082158, or read our
Frequently Asked Questions at http://www.hearfromyourmp.com/faq

All the best,
The HearFromYourMP Team
