Subject: HearFromYourMP.com update - you've now got <?=$values['subscribers']?> constituents subscribed

Dear <?=$values['mp_forename']?>,

This is just an automatic update email to let you know that there are
now <?=$values['subscribers']?> constituents in

All you have to do to send a new message is visit:
    <?=$values['message_url']?>

You've used the service before, so this is just a short email. We'll
remind you again when you have <?=$values['next_threshold']?>, but
we won't email again for at least one month.
